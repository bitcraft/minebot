I'm a little robot, short and plain.
This is my readme, i have no name.
When you get on Minecraft
Run the script
Do some damage and
Watch me crash.

Needs some changes to the vanilla bravo library to run.
I'll post them after I figure out how to fork bravo correctly.

What works:
    Login with minecraft.net
    Login with server
    Movement
    Geometry

What doesn't:
    Probably anything you would want it to do.



Cheers.
