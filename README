I'm a little robot, short and plain.
This is my readme, i have no name.
When you get on Minecraft
Run the script
Do some damage and
Watch me crash.

Needs some changes to the vanilla bravo library to run.
Should work with the version under my account

What works:
    Login with minecraft.net
    Login with server
    Movement
    Geometry
    Gravity
    Bot/Player Inventory
    Chat
    Health
    Respawn

What doesn't:
    Probably anything you would want it to do.



Cheers.
